# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard which presents the user with a way to view the current weather and 5-day weather forecast. This dashboard uses CSS Framework from UI Kit, so no css file had to be made here. It also utilizes Day.js to format unix times. To get the weather data based off of the name of the city, 3 data sets from Open Weather API were used.

## Installation

To reach this weather dashboard, the user just has to go to the site [here](https://claricetran.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
